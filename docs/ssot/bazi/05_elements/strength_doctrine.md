\# Strength \& Weakness Doctrine (身强身弱) — SSOT



This document defines the ONLY valid method to assess Day Master strength.



---



\## CORE PRINCIPLE



\- Strength (身强 / 身弱) is a STRUCTURAL assessment

\- It is NOT an interpretation

\- It does NOT change the Day Master

\- It precedes all favorable/unfavorable judgement



---



\## INPUT FACTORS (IN ORDER)



Strength assessment must consider, in strict order:



1\. \*\*Seasonal Influence (月令)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Month Branch dominance

&nbsp;  - Primary determinant

&nbsp;  - No other factor may override season



2\. \*\*Rooting (通根)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Presence of Day Master element in:

&nbsp;    - Day Branch

&nbsp;    - Month Branch

&nbsp;    - Year / Hour Branch (descending weight)



3\. \*\*Support Elements\*\*

&nbsp;  - Resource (印)

&nbsp;  - Companion (比劫)

&nbsp;  - Counted only if structurally present



4\. \*\*Drain / Control Elements\*\*

&nbsp;  - Output (食伤)

&nbsp;  - Wealth (财)

&nbsp;  - Officer / Killings (官杀)

\## WEIGHTING RULES



\- Seasonal influence has highest weight

\- Rooting outranks surface stems

\- Quantity never overrides position

\- Hidden stems are valid contributors



No numeric scoring is defined at SSOT level.

Scoring models are implementation details.

\## CLASSIFICATION OUTPUT



Engine MUST output one of:



\- Strong (身强)

\- Weak (身弱)

\- Balanced (中和)

\- Follow Structure (从强 / 从弱)



---



\## FOLLOW STRUCTURE RULE



Follow charts (从格) apply ONLY if:

\- Day Master has no effective rooting

\- Opposing structure is dominant

\- No rescue elements exist



Follow classification is rare.

Default assumption is NON-follow.

\## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES



Invalid methods include:

\- Counting stems without season

\- Ignoring rooting

\- Using Ten Gods quantity alone

\- Applying luck pillars to redefine natal strength



---



\## ENGINE CONTRACT



Engine must expose:

\- `strength.classification`

\- `strength.factors.season`

\- `strength.factors.rooting`

\- `strength.factors.support`

\- `strength.factors.control`



Interpretation layers may read but never alter these.



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE



\- Strength is assessed ONCE at natal level

\- Luck Pillars modify expression, not identity

\- Any contradiction indicates engine error



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
