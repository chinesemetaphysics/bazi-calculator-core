\# Luck Pillars (大运) Doctrine — SSOT



This document defines the ONLY valid rules for Luck Pillars derivation and usage.



---



\## DEFINITION



\- Luck Pillars (大运) are 10-year cycles

\- They represent macro environmental influence

\- They DO NOT change natal identity



---



\## DERIVATION ORDER



Luck Pillars derivation must follow this order:



1\. Natal chart completed

2\. Gender determined

3\. Direction determined

4\. Start age calculated

5\. 10-year pillars sequenced



No step may be skipped.

\## DIRECTION RULE



Direction is determined by:



\- Gender

\- Yin/Yang polarity of Day Master



Rules:

\- Yang Day Master:

&nbsp; - Male → Forward

&nbsp; - Female → Reverse

\- Yin Day Master:

&nbsp; - Male → Reverse

&nbsp; - Female → Forward



Forward = move from Month Pillar forward  

Reverse = move backward



---



\## START AGE (起运年龄)



\- Calculated from birth moment to nearest solar term

\- Forward:

&nbsp; - Birth → next solar term

\- Reverse:

&nbsp; - Birth → previous solar term



Conversion:

\- 3 days = 1 year

\- Remainder converted to months



---



\## SEQUENCING RULE



\- Each Luck Pillar spans exactly 10 years

\- Pillars follow Heavenly Stem + Earthly Branch sequence

\- Sequence MUST align with Month Pillar progression



---



\## INTERACTION WITH NATAL



Luck Pillars:

\- Modify expression

\- Activate or suppress Ten Gods

\- Influence timing



They NEVER:

\- Change Day Master

\- Redefine strength

\- Override SSOT doctrine



---



\## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES



Invalid:

\- Starting Luck Pillars from Year Pillar

\- Using rounded ages without calculation

\- Applying modern calendar shortcuts

\- Using luck to redefine natal strength



---



\## ENGINE CONTRACT



Engine must expose:

\- `luck\_pillars.direction`

\- `luck\_pillars.start\_age`

\- `luck\_pillars.sequence\[]`

\- `luck\_pillars.current`



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE



\- Luck Pillars are immutable once derived

\- Any recalculation requires SSOT version bump



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
