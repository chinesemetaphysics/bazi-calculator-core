\# Ten Gods (十神) Doctrine — SSOT



This document defines the ONLY valid Ten Gods derivation and usage rules.



---



\## DEFINITION



\- Ten Gods describe the relationship between:

&nbsp; - Day Master (reference)

&nbsp; - Other Heavenly Stems (target)

\- Relationship is based on:

&nbsp; - Five Elements interaction

&nbsp; - Yin/Yang polarity



---



\## DERIVATION AXIS



Ten Gods are determined by:

1\. Element relationship to Day Master

2\. Polarity match or opposition



Both conditions are mandatory.



---



\## CANONICAL TEN GODS TABLE



Same element:

\- 比肩 (Friend): Same element, same polarity

\- 劫财 (Rob Wealth): Same element, opposite polarity



Day Master generates target:

\- 食神 (Eating God): DM generates, same polarity

\- 伤官 (Hurting Officer): DM generates, opposite polarity



Target generates Day Master:

\- 正印 (Direct Resource): Target generates DM, opposite polarity

\- 偏印 (Indirect Resource): Target generates DM, same polarity



Day Master controls target:

\- 正财 (Direct Wealth): DM controls, opposite polarity

\- 偏财 (Indirect Wealth): DM controls, same polarity



Target controls Day Master:

\- 正官 (Direct Officer): Target controls DM, opposite polarity

\- 七杀 (Seven Killings): Target controls DM, same polarity



---



\## SCOPE OF APPLICATION



Ten Gods apply to:

\- Heavenly Stems ONLY

\- All pillars (Year, Month, Day, Hour)

\- Luck Pillars and annual flows



Branches derive Ten Gods ONLY after hidden stems extraction.



---



\## FORBIDDEN INTERPRETATIONS



Invalid practices:

\- Assigning Ten Gods without polarity check

\- Using branches directly without hidden stems

\- Using strength to redefine Ten Gods

\- Reducing Seven Killings to “bad god”



---



\## ORDER OF OPERATIONS



1\. Determine Day Master

2\. Extract target Heavenly Stem

3\. Compare element interaction

4\. Compare polarity

5\. Assign Ten God



Order is mandatory.



---



\## ENGINE CONTRACT



Engine must expose per pillar:

\- `ten\_gods.primary`

\- `ten\_gods.by\_hidden\_stem\[]`

\- `ten\_gods.source\_stem`



No post-processing reinterpretation allowed.



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE



\- Ten Gods are relational, not qualitative

\- Meaning emerges only after strength analysis

\- Ten Gods NEVER change identity



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
