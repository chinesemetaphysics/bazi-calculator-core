\# BaZi Four Pillars Derivation Doctrine (SSOT)



This document defines the ONLY valid method to derive the Four Pillars.



---



\## YEAR PILLAR (年柱)



\### Rule

\- Determined by solar year

\- Year changes at 立春 (Start of Spring)

\- Uses Heavenly Stem + Earthly Branch from 60 JiaZi cycle



\### Binding

\- Birth before 立春 → previous JiaZi year

\- Birth at or after 立春 → current JiaZi year



\### Forbidden

\- Gregorian year

\- Lunar New Year

\- User locale calendar



---



\## MONTH PILLAR (月柱)



\### Rule

\- Month is solar-term based

\- Each month begins at a major solar term (節)

\- Month branch fixed sequence:

  寅 → 卯 → 辰 → 巳 → 午 → 未 → 申 → 酉 → 戌 → 亥 → 子 → 丑



\### Heavenly Stem

\- Derived from Year Stem using fixed mapping formula

\- No deviation allowed



---



\## DAY PILLAR (日柱)



\### Rule

\- Continuous 60-day JiaZi cycle

\- No breaks, no resets

\- Calculated after timezone normalization



\### Binding

\- Date rollover strictly at local apparent midnight

\- Day pillar must match astronomical ephemeris



---



\## HOUR PILLAR (時柱)



\### Rule

\- Based on 12 two-hour segments (時辰)

\- Zi hour spans 23:00–00:59 (apparent solar time)



\### Hour Branch

\- Determined solely by birth time



\### Hour Stem

\- Derived from Day Stem using fixed lookup table



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE

\- All four pillars must originate from the SAME normalized timestamp

\- No pillar may be derived independently



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
