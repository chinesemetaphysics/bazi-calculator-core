\# Day Master (日主) Doctrine — SSOT



This document defines the ONLY valid rules for identifying and using the Day Master.



---



\## DEFINITION



\- The Day Master (日主) is the Heavenly Stem of the Day Pillar

\- It represents the self (命主)

\- All relational systems derive from it



---



\## IDENTIFICATION RULE



\- Day Master = Day Pillar Heavenly Stem

\- No exception

\- No transformation

\- No averaging

\- No substitution



Example:

\- Day Pillar = 丙申

\- Day Master = 丙 (Yang Fire)



---



\## SCOPE OF AUTHORITY



The Day Master is the reference point for:

\- Ten Gods (十神)

\- Elemental balance (五行)

\- Strength / weakness analysis

\- Luck Pillars interaction

\- Health, career, relationship interpretation



---



\## FORBIDDEN INTERPRETATIONS



The following are explicitly invalid:

\- Using Day Branch as Day Master

\- Using strongest element as Day Master

\- Using Year / Month stem as proxy

\- Altering Day Master based on strength



---



\## STRENGTH VS IDENTITY



\- Day Master identity NEVER changes

\- Strength / weakness is a SEPARATE layer

\- Weak ≠ changed Day Master

\- Strong ≠ dominant chart owner



---



\## ENGINE CONTRACT



\- Engine must expose:

&nbsp; - `day\_master.stem`

&nbsp; - `day\_master.element`

&nbsp; - `day\_master.polarity`

\- No downstream module may override Day Master



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE



\- Day Master is immutable once calculated

\- Any system violating this doctrine is incorrect



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
