\# System Integration Doctrine — SSOT



This document defines how all metaphysics systems integrate without conflict.



---



\## CORE PRINCIPLE



Each system has a \*\*distinct role\*\*.

No system may override another outside its domain.



---



\## SYSTEM ROLES



\### BaZi

\- Defines:

&nbsp; - Natal identity

&nbsp; - Structural strengths and weaknesses

&nbsp; - Long-term tendencies



\### Luck Pillars \& Flows

\- Define:

&nbsp; - Timing of activation

&nbsp; - Environmental cycles

\- They modify expression, not identity



\### Feng Shui

\- Defines:

&nbsp; - Environmental support

&nbsp; - Spatial influence

\- Cannot override natal constraints



\### Qi Men Dun Jia

\- Defines:

&nbsp; - Tactical decision-making

&nbsp; - Event-specific strategy

\- Cannot redefine destiny or structure



\### Date Selection

\- Defines:

&nbsp; - Optimal timing

\- Advisory only

\## HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY (HIGHEST → LOWEST)



1\. Time Doctrine

2\. SSOT Governance

3\. BaZi Natal Structure

4\. Luck Pillars (大运)

5\. Flow Luck (流年 → 流月 → 流日 → 流时)

6\. Feng Shui

7\. Date Selection

8\. Qi Men Dun Jia



Lower layers may refine decisions but NEVER override higher layers.

\## DATA FLOW MODEL



Input →

Time Normalization →

BaZi Natal →

Luck Pillars →

Flows →

Feng Shui / Date Selection →

Qi Men (if applicable) →

Output



No reverse flow is allowed.



---



\## OUTPUT RULES



\- Each output must:

&nbsp; - Declare system used

&nbsp; - Declare scope

&nbsp; - Declare limitations

\- Composite dashboards must separate sections



---



\## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES



Invalid:

\- Mixing interpretations across systems

\- Using Qi Men to justify natal contradictions

\- Feng Shui remedies for BaZi structural issues

\- Date selection overriding hard conflicts



---



\## ENGINE CONTRACT



Engine must enforce:

\- System boundaries

\- Execution order

\- Explicit context passing



---



\## NON-NEGOTIABLE



\- Integration errors are system bugs

\- Silence is not acceptable; conflicts must be surfaced



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
