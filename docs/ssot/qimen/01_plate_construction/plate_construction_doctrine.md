\## CORE PRINCIPLE



\- Qi Men charts are EVENT-BASED

\- Chart is constructed for:

&nbsp; - A specific moment

&nbsp; - At a specific location

\- Natal data is NOT used



---



\## INPUT REQUIREMENTS



Required:

\- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)

\- Time (HH:MM)

\- Location



Optional:

\- Solar adjustment (advanced)



---



\## SYSTEM TYPE



\- Default system: 时家奇门 (Hour-based Qi Men)

\- Other systems are explicitly unsupported

\## YIN / YANG DUN

\- Center palace may be empty

\- Fixed spatial orientation

\- Identical inputs MUST produce identical plates



This doctrine is binding across all systems.
